# Surgical data science for next-generation interventions
## Basic Information
* link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-017-0132-7
* abstract: basic applications and problems of surgical data science

## applications
### Decision support

> whether to operate/type of surgery

Leakage of full record

### Context-aware assistance

> monitor procedures(remaining duration prediction / resources scheduling)

* needle navigation
* perfusion monitoring
* (assistant) decision support
* context-aware augmented reality
* cognitive robotics

### Surgical training

> simulation and assessment

## challenges

### data
source / privacy concerns / unstandardized / cooperation with scenarios(resource-intensive)

### analysis
1.modelling orchestrated actions(medical teams) and response (patients)
2.robustness(irreversible)
3.rapid
4.highly specific
5.integrated with other...

### incentives??
>(balance with clinical practice)

society support->database

### industry
need of market opportunities
hurdles of data regulation

### patients??
>(cogent and user-friendly surgical data science)

* da Vinci surgical system
